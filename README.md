# Logistic Regresion pythagorean win Percentage
<p> This notebook has the calculation of a pytegorian win percentage of the 2018 premier league season, the pythagorean win percentage will be used to classified the outcome of the matches. There will be a implementation of Logistic regression using te Stocahastic Gradient Descent to optimize the loss function.
<p>The data used in this notebook was taken from <a>https://www.football-data.co.uk/books.php</a> by joseph buchdahl.The implamentation of the logistic regression model was made based on the information in the WebSite "Real Python" <a>https://realpython.com/gradient-descent-algorithm-python/</a>. The Pythagorean win percentage topic is explained in <a>https://www.coursera.org/learn/prediction-models-sports-data/</a></p>
